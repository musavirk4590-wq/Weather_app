# "What's the Weather?" App

A foundational Python project that demonstrates how to work with external APIs to fetch and display live, real-world data. The application asks the user for a city name and displays the current weather and temperature using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Skills Showcased

* **Python**
* **APIs:** Making requests and parsing JSON responses.
* **Libraries:** `requests`
* **Error Handling:** Basic checks for successful API calls.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the required library:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
3.  **Important:** You must get your own free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and replace the `API_KEY` placeholder in the `weather.py` script.
4.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python weather.py
    ```
